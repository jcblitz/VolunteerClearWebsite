## Image Optimization Guidelines

All images should be optimized for web:

1. **Format**: Use WebP format with JPEG/PNG fallbacks
2. **Compression**: Compress images to < 200KB each
3. **Responsive**: Provide multiple sizes for responsive images
4. **Alt Text**: Ensure all images have descriptive alt text in components

## Current Status

Currently, the website uses:
- Heroicons for all icon needs (no custom icons required)
- CSS gradients and shapes for visual elements
- Placeholder backgrounds where images would go

To add real images, simply place them in this directory and update the component references.
